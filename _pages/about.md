Robin (Hung-Ching) is a master’s student studying Computer Science at Columbia University. He has a strong understanding of CS fundamentals and a great passion for building large-scale software systems that are both scalable and reliable. He believes that software systems provide leverage for making a significant impact on the world by writing just a few lines of code.

Previously, Robin worked as a software engineer at TrendMicro for two years, focusing on back-end development, cloud-native technologies, and ETL data pipelines. His team’s goal was to provide cyber threat and cyber attack visibility to their customers. He has proven skills in C++, Java, and Python, and he excels in teamwork and collaboration to drive projects forward. He successfully launched a new feature that increased visibility on network cyber threats and presented it to over 160 project managers, regional sales and engineers. He also supported the team to reduce Azure cloud costs by 50%.

He is extremely excited about Generative AI and Large Language Model (LLM) technologies, and the future they are leading us toward. He is open to new and exciting opportunities. Feel free to connect if you'd like to start a conversation with him.
